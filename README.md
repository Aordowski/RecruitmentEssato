How to set up 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make sure you have the .net installed (if not, you can get it here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
2. This application uses Microsoft SQL server, make sure you have that installed (if not, you can get it here https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
3. If you have Visual Studio - you can open the ZadanieRekrutacyjne.sln file to see it in Visual studio
4. If you want the .exe file , it is in the repository, look in /bin/Debug/net8.0-windowsZadanieRekrutacyjne.exe
5. This application will ask you for the server name, it is the same as your computer's name , if you dont know how to check it, here is a tutorial https://www.howtogeek.com/866780/how-to-find-your-computer-name-in-windows-10/
   I used free api, so the app can do only 10000 API calls per day
